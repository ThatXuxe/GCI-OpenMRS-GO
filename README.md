# GCI-OpenMRS-GO
Task for Google Code-in based on GoLang


## Advantages of Go over others
- Goroutines: concurrency is simple to implement with Go, and Goroutines provide a useful way to run concurrent tasks
- Binary compiling: Since Go compiles directly to binary, compiling dependencies is extremely convenient
- Dependency management: is centralized and exteremely simple
- Go: is a lightweight language, which makes it extremely efficient to process large amounts of data that is neccessary for backend design.
